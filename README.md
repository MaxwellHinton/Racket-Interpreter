As a university project, I developed an interpreter in Racket for a small subset of the JavaScript language. 

It features a lexer and parser generated with the SLLgen library and supports 

 - variable declarations
 - functions.
 - Recursive functions with conditions.
 - Chained and compound functions.
 - conditionals and complex logical statements.
 - Arithmetic expressions.
